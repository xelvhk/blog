# Blog application on PHP
Simple blog system made with PHP, the Apache web server and SQLite.

### Functions:
- publish post
- add comment to post
- view all post
- delete post or comment

### How to install
You need to install a web server application on your machine. I recommend XAMPP (Apache + MySQL).

- Move repository files to xampp directory/htdocs (this is the public webserver folder)
